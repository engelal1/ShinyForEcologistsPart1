# data processing

# This file contains the data processing scripts used to make the
# named lists of sites and the simplified, summarized data that we use in the app.
# If you want to modify this file for your own project, you'll have to change the paths, etc.

# Very important note!!!
# You don't have to have .rds files to make a shiny app.
# You can use .csv's, .xls's, or any other data format you like.
# I just like to use .rds files, which are like r data objects written to file
# because they retain factor levels etc. so we don't have to include data cleaning code
# in our app, and our app code will be more concise. 

library(tidyverse)
# install.packages('forcats')
library(forcats)

# forcats is a great package for working with factors, and it has a super cute hex.

# load data

# make varaiable for mean of pup count at each site in each year
# Also clean up site name and make it look nice for our human users

                  dplyr::select(year, sitename, meanPups) %>%

# Make "All" the first factor level. 
# This will make it the default for the dropdown/ put it at the top of the list.

# Now we make a named list of site choice levels, which are now indexes
# This makes our dropdown code simpler.
